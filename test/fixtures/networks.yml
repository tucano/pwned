barabasi:
  name: Barabasi
  description: 
      Albert-László Barabási (born March 30, 1967) is a Romanian-born 
      Hungarian scientist. He is the former Emil T. Hofmann professor at the 
      University of Notre Dame and current Distinguished Professor and Director of 
      Northeastern University's Center for Network Science and an associate member 
      of the Center of Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB) at the Dana Farber Cancer 
      Institute, Harvard University. He introduced in 1999 the concept of 
      scale-free networks and proposed the Barabasi-Albert model to explain 
      their widespread emergence in natural, technological and 
      social systems, from the cellular telephone to the WWW or online communities.

google:
  name: Google
  description:
   In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search 
   engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. 
   We assume page A has pages T1...Tn which point to it (i.e., are citations). 
   The parameter d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1. 
   We usually set d to 0.85. There are more details about d in the next section. 
   Also C(A) is defined as the number of links going out of page A. The PageRank of a page A is given as follows
   PR(A) = (1-d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))
   Note that the PageRanks form a probability distribution over web pages, so the sum of all web pages' PageRanks will be one.

    www.HPRD.org offers a centralized platform to visualize domain architecture, 
    post-translational modifications, interaction networks and disease association 
    for each protein in the human proteome. Includes map of pathways and

tp53:
  name: TP53
  description:
    This gene encodes tumor protein p53, which responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate 
    target genes that induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes 
    in metabolism. p53 protein is expressed at low level in normal cells and at a high level 
    in a variety of transformed cell lines, where it's believed to contribute to transformation and malignancy.
