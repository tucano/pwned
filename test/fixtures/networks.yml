  description: 
  Albert-László Barabási (born March 30, 1967) is a Romanian-born 
  Hungarian scientist. He is the former Emil T. Hofmann professor at the 
  University of Notre Dame and current Distinguished Professor and Director of 
  Northeastern University's Center for Network Science and an associate member 
  of the Center of Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB) at the Dana Farber Cancer 
  Institute, Harvard University. He introduced in 1999 the concept of 
  scale-free networks and proposed the Barabasi-Albert model to explain 
  their widespread emergence in natural, technological and 
  social systems, from the cellular telephone to the WWW or online communities.
